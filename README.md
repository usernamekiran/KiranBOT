## About
This repository contains the main programs/scripts for the [Pywikibot](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikibot) and [AutoWiki Browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser) (AWB). It does not include the framework or other background files.

## Installation

To use the Python programs/scripts, you will need to have Pywikibot installed. For using C# programs, you will need AutoWiki Browser (AWB). Follow the instructions on the official documentation to set it up.

## Usage

### Pywikibot
Pywikibot can be used on any MediaWiki website, including over **300** language editions of Wikipedia. Like English Wikipedia, Cebuano Wikipedia, and German Wikipedia.

In addition to Wikipedia, Pywikibot can also be used on other MediaWiki sites such as Wikimedia Commons, Wiktionary, Wikidata, Wikiquote, among many others

To use Pywikibot, kindly refer to the official [Pywikibot manual](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikibot/Installation) for detailed instructions on running scripts from your computer or server.

### AutoWiki Browser (AWB)
AWB is primarily used for editing Wikipedia and other MediaWiki sites. It provides a user-friendly interface for bulk editing and making repetitive changes, making it a great tool for editors who want to streamline their workflow. AWB can also be used on:

- Fandom wikis (previously Wikia)
- Various other MediaWiki-powered sites
- Community wikis for collaborative projects

To use AWB, kindly refer to the official [AWB manual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser/User_manual) for detailed instructions. Howevever, unlike pywikibot AWB runs only from your computer, and not from a server.
